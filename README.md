# kalitools

Handy CTF tools for kali. Needs ~20gb of disk space, so hopefully your image is bigger than that
Mostly for x64 Kali, may work for x86

`git clone https://github.com/c-sto/kalitools && bash ./kalitools/gettools.sh`

Install a bunch of non-standard kali stuff automagically.
Probably won't be maintained good.
